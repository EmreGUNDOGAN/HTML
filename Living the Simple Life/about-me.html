          My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
        </h2>

        <p class="article-par">
          <strong> I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I
          thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any
          of it because there was too much.
        </p>
        <p class="article-par">
          Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
          want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
        </p>
        <h3 class="colored-title">How I turned things around</h3>
        <p class="article-par">
          <strong>
            I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
            everything.</strong
          >
          I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
          and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
        </p>
        <p class="article-par">
          It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
          place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
        </p>
        <h3 class="colored-title">Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p class="article-par">
          Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less
          stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to
          enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="article-par">
          With how much it turned my life around,<strong>
            I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
            it,</strong
          >
          and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is
          why I started this site!
