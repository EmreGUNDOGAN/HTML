        <h2>Time line of Marie Curie's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1867</b> - Curie born in Warsaw</li>
          <li>
            <b>1883</b> - Skłodowska wins a gold medal as top student in her
            class upon completion of her secondary education
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1891</b> - Skłodowska moves to Paris in 1891 to study at the
            Sorbonne. She begins to use the name Marie. She studies far into the
            night and completes degrees in physics and math.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1895</b> - Marie and Pierre marry on July 25. She takes her

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1896</b> - In 1896 a French scientist named Henri Becquerel finds
            that the element uranium gives off unusual rays of energy. He passes
            his findings on to Marie, who begins studying the phenomenon, which
            she later names radioactivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1898</b> - In 1898 the Curies announce their discovery of two new
            elements, radium and polonium. They name polonium after Marie’s
            homeland of Poland.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1903</b> - Marie earns her doctorate of science in June, becoming
            the first woman in France to receive a doctoral degree. In November
            Marie and Pierre share with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics
            for the discovery and research of radioactivity.
            <strong>Marie is the first woman to receive the honor.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1906</b> - Pierre dies in a traffic accident on April 19. Marie
            takes over his professorship at the Sorbonne in May. She is the
            first woman to teach there. She devotes all of her energy to
            completing alone the scientific work that she and Pierre had
            undertaken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1910</b> - 1910 Marie’s fundamental treatise on radioactivity is
            published.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1911</b> - Marie is awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for
            the isolation of pure radium.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1914</b> - World War I begins in 1914. Throughout the war Marie,
            with the help of her daughter Irène devotes herself to making X-ray
            technology available for use in the medical treatment of wounded
            soldiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1912</b> - From this date Marie focuses her research on the
            chemistry of radioactive substances and the medical applications of
            these substances.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1934</b> - Marie dies near Sallanches, France. Her death is the

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1944</b> - American chemists discover a new element. They name it
