          HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to
          <strong class="strong-words"> control the element's behaviour</strong

          attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type
          or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function
          correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an
          HTML start tag.

        <p class="section-par">
          Some attribute types function differently when used to modify
          different element types. For example, the attribute name is used by

        <p class="section-par">
          In computing, a <strong class="strong-par"> hyperlink</strong>, or
          simply a <strong class="strong-par"> link</strong>, is a reference to
          data that the user can follow by clicking or tapping. A hyperlink
          points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.
          Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is
          called anchor text.
          <em class="em-par">
            A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is
            a hypertext system, and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or
            simply to link) </em
          >. A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the
          hypertext.
        </p>
        <p class="section-par">
          The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document.
          For example, in an online reference work such as Wikipedia, or Google,
          many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of
          those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference
          mechanisms such as tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies,
          indexes, letters, and glossaries.

          A <strong class="strong-par"> webform, web form </strong> or
          <strong class="strong-par"> HTML form</strong> on a web page allows a
          user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can
          resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms
          using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms
          can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product,
          or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.
        </p>
        <p class="section-par">
          These elements can be combined into a form or in some instances used
          separately as user-interface controls; in the document, they can be
          simple HTML or used in conjunction with Scripts. HTML markup specifies
          the elements that make up a form, and the method by which it will be
          submitted. However, some form of scripts (server-side, client-side, or
          both) must be used to process the user's input once it is submitted.

          hn tags, n meaning any of the available heading levels. Most visual
          browsers show headings as large bold text by default, though this can
          be overridden with CSS. Heading elements are not intended merely for
          creating large or bold text – in fact, they should not be used for
          explicitly styling text. Rather, they describe the document's
          structure and organization. Some programs use them to generate
          outlines and tables of contents.

        <p class="section-par">
          <strong class="strong-par"> HTML colors </strong> are colors used in
          displaying web pages on the World Wide Web, and the methods for
          describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as an
          RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet) or according to
          their common English names in some cases. A color tool or other
          graphics software is often used to generate color values. In some
          uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a
          leading number sign (#).A color is specified according to the
          intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by
          eight bits. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within
          the sRGB gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.
        </p>
        <p class="section-par">
          RGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the
          0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This
          number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder)
          gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters
          A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See hexadecimal for more
          details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For
          instance, the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the
          first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9.
          This process is repeated for each of the three color values.
